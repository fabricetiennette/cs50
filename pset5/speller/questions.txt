0.  An invented long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.  It returns resource usage measures for a process. Example CPU time used, Memory size, Data size...

2.  There's 16 variable.

3.  2 structures will be copied int [calculate] 

4.  The main() function starts reading a text char-by-char with the objective of constructing seperate words. 
    its completed when one or more alphabete symbols are read.then we check for misspellings words. reset the word index to zero
    and continue the symbol reading loop. If a digit is encounter or a string lenght is too long we bypass this word in the text and wont check it for 
    misspelling.
     
5.  There a bench of problem using fscanf you must allocate memory for a string before reading it from a file and there are no limits of a length of a word 
    in a text file. Also you can't write program logically for skipping alphanumeric words, like the same implementation of speller.
    This approach gives less flexibility.
    
6.  Those parameters are never intented to be modified in the functions, so we wrote an 
    other layer of ensuring this behavior.
